      <p>Introduction

      Marie Skłodowska-Curie, one of the most outstanding figures in the history of science, was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw. Her life and achievements revolutionized many fields, and her contributions to science continue to inspire generations.
      Education
      
      Marie demonstrated extraordinary abilities from a young age. After finishing school in Warsaw, she was unable to study at Polish universities due to restrictions on women. In 1891, she moved to Paris, where she began her studies at the Sorbonne. She graduated with honors, earning a doctorate in physical sciences.
      Scientific Discoveries
      
      Together with her husband, Pierre Curie, Marie discovered two chemical elements: polonium and radium. Their work on radioactivity was groundbreaking and contributed to the development of radiochemistry. In 1903, for their joint research on radioactivity, Marie and Pierre Curie, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Marie became the first woman to receive this award.
      Further Achievements
      
      After her husband’s death in 1906, Marie continued her research. In 1911, she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her studies on radium and its compounds. She was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.
      Contribution to Medicine
      
      Marie Skłodowska-Curie also contributed to the field of medicine, particularly in radiology. Her research on radioactivity was crucial for cancer treatment. During World War I, she organized mobile radiology units that helped diagnose wounded soldiers.
      Final Years and Legacy
      
      Marie passed away on July 4, 1934, due to radiation-related illness, likely caused by prolonged exposure to radiation. After her death, she was buried alongside her husband in the Panthéon in Paris. Her achievements and life became an inspiration for many women who sought to find their place in science.
      Conclusion
      
      Marie Skłodowska-Curie was not only an exceptional scientist but also a pioneer in the fight for gender equality in science. Her life and work demonstrate how passion and determination can lead to groundbreaking discoveries that change the world. Her legacy endures to this day, inspiring future generations of scientists.
